      <h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>We had some challenges working on trying to combine both bonus task 1 and
      bonus task 2. We wanted to be able to refactor the code, while being able to
      display the house descriptions. There was also a minor challenge with figuring
      out how to change the image displayed on the page, depending on what house
      you're in. But after finding a w3schools link on it, we were able to easily
      implement it to our page. Another challenge that we had was that the code wasn't
      working for one of our computers. For example, when the user would press the submit
      button, it would get rid of the id that was listed for that paragraph tag. Later on
      we realized it was because we were supposed to move the paragraph tag outside
      of the div tag.</p>
      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>Bonus task questions 3 and 4 were pretty hard to overcome and are the
      only problems we came across.</p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>The results can be seen on our page.</p>
