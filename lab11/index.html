      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>The instructions were very confusing, because we didn't really
      understand what the lab was asking for. The most difficult question for us to
      comprehend was number 3 of task 3. We didn't know what it meant by "toggle".
      Originally, we looked at another website that mentioned a method for toggling,
      but we later realized that it was using the DOM syntax. It was giving us an
      error, since we were using jQuery syntax, so when the TA clarified in Discord,
      we found out how to use the toggle method with the jQuery syntax.</p>

      <p>Overall, we felt that this lab was pretty challenging, however there
      were no problems.</p>
