      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>	Some general challenges we had with Lab 10 were with relearning how to
        use the sort() function that we had created in an earlier lab. We looked
        through our code and from the comments that were left before, we were
        able to remember why we wrote certain pieces of the code. A challenge
        that we had with bonus task 2 was debugging, especially because most
        of the bugs were very simple mistakes. We would keep forgetting what
        we named our variables and would accidentally use names that were very
        similar to the variable name, which caused the page to produce an
        unintended effect. </p>
      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>	There were no problems with the lab.</p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>Our results can be seen on our page.</p>
