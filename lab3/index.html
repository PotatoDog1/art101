		<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>We didn't really have any difficulties with this lab because all the folders
			 were already set up from the start. However, if we were to actually set up
			 the folders by ourselves, then we probably would have problems with organization.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>As expected, our folders are all organized. The proper image and css files are
			 under their respective lab folders.</p>
