        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>We had trouble choosing which elements and attributes
        to use in our webpage. One problem was looking for a method or attribute that
        made sense, and the second problem was finding something that would be useful
        for our page. The first bonus task was challenging because we were confused
        on what the question was asking for. We also had some minor issues with
        typing the correct casing for the in-built JavaScript methods, so there was
        some debugging with that.</p>
        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>We had problems with trying to get document.domain
        to work. There were no error messages, but nothing would show up on the console
        when we tried to use it. We later found out, from a website, that the
        domain method is deprecated and is not recommended to use. We think this
        might've been the reason for not working but we aren't too sure about that.</p>
