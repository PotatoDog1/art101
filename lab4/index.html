	<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
	<div>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>Our first challenge was thinking of an every day task that students weren't
			 too familiar with. The second challenge was surely enough to think about
			 a computer task we wanted to pseudocode.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>We had problems with trying to figure out whether our pseudocode was high level
			enough.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>We produced pseudocode for how to build a build-a-bear and computer
		pseudocode that details how to make a chess game, as seen below:</p>

			<h3>Task 1: Steps to build a Build-a-Bear</h3>
			<ol>
				<li> Choose an animal that you would like to build.</li>
				<li> Decide on a sound effect to add to your animal.</li>
				<li> Pick out a heart and kiss it.</li>
				<li> Stuff the animal with stuffing and the heart that you choose.</li>
				<li> Hug your animal.</li>
				<li> Choose an outfit for your animal and dress them up.</li>
				<li> Name your animal, take the birth certificate provided.</li>
				<li> Take your animal home.</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Task 2: Creating a Chess Game</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Print the board before each turn.</li>
				<li>Player evaluates possible moves.</li>
				<li>Accept user input.</li>
				<li>Validate user move.</li>
				<li>Evaluate possible moves for the computer.</li>
				<li>Choose a move for the computer.</li>
				<li>Test for Win! condition.</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Task 3: Turn Pseudocode into Comments</h3>
			<pre>
// Players choose white/black pieces
 	 // First player picks color of pieces (black or white)
 	 // Automatically assign second player with the other color
 // Print the board with pieces in default spaces.
   // Loop through each row
     // Loop through each space
       // Print either a piece or a space
       // Print a | in between
     // Print a newline at the end
     // Print a horizontal line between
 // White moves first
 // Print the board before each turn.
   // Loop through each row
     // Loop through each space
       // Print either a piece or a space
       // Print a | in between
     // Print a newline at the end
     // Print a horizontal line between
 // Black evaluates possible moves.
 // Accept user input.
   // Prompt user to choose chess piece to move
 // Validate user move.
   // Check player input against possible moves
 // Black evaluates possible moves
 // Black chooses a move
 // Test for Win! Condition.
