      <h1>Lab 15: AJAX</h1>
      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>	The first challenge, for us, was understanding the instructions for task 2.
        We were confused in what Wes meant by the “docs” for our API and picking an endpoint.
        We were unsure of what Wes meant by the docs, as we didn’t remember hearing about it
        in class, and we didn’t know what they wanted us to do. We still don’t understand
        the stuff with AJAX, but we used Wes’ code as reference.We also found that when
        we tried to run the code locally on our machine, we would get a CORS error.
        Someone in the class Discord said that it was because the APIs don’t like
        it when we test things locally. We ended up downloading a Chrome
        extension that would allow us to run the API, and it worked.</p>
      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>	For the most part, we had no problems and when we did we were able to
        figure out the problems. One thing that might be considered a problem
        is that we were doing the bonus task using NASA’s Astronomy Picture of
        the Day (APOD), and we found that when we were trying to do it on our
        own, there was a little img icon on the webpage, almost as if an image
        was supposed to show up. Additionally, there was a strange error in
        the console that we didn’t understand. We didn’t know how to fix the
        problem, or how to use the API docs that NASA provided, so our
        alternative was to find a tutorial online that uses the REST API
        to work with NASA’s APOD. There is no error message anymore, but
        no image icon showing up either. We are not sure if this is a
        problem, or if it has worked the way it is supposed to.</p>
