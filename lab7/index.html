      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>It was a bit challenging to make our own folders and files for Lab 7,
      since all of the other folders previously to lab 7 were already premade,
      however we easily got used to it. The most challenging part in this lab was
      the Bonus Task. </p
      <p>Bonus Task X #1: The sort() function makes all the uppercase
      letters go before any lowercase letters. We didn’t know any ways to sort an
      array with lowercase letters and uppercase letters together so we looked
      up online how to do this. We ended up going to stackoverflow and scrolled
      down until we saw Intl.Collator().compare being used as a parameter for the
      sort function. We don’t necessarily know what it means but it does sort
      uppercase and lowercase letters together.</p>
      <p>Bonus Task X #2: We first had to
      understand the question. We were confused on whether "omit[ting] spaces"
      meant that we could remove the space from the original array, or if there
      was another way to do it. Another challenge is that when we figured out how
      to take out the spaces, we decided that we wanted to put them back in.
      In the end, we decided to go with a while loop, and as long there were
      still spaces in the array, we would collect them in a list and later push
      them back into the array for aesthetic purposes. Bonus Task X #3: Similarly
      to the second part for the bonus task, we had no clue on how to shuffle
      around the letters within the array. Again, we headed to stackoverflow and
      scrolled down to see the different answers. We saw many loop examples but
      without yet touching on loops or conditional statements, we didn’t want to
      use any of the loop examples. As we continued searching we found a way how
      Math.random() was helpful with our particular problem. We used the sort
      function once again and had () => .5 - Math.random() as the parameters
      which solved the problem, kinda. </p>
      <p>Bonus Task X #4: We were under the
      assumption that we wouldn't be able to affect the JS file with the CSS,
      since we had previously tried to do so in a different lab. Regardless of
      whether we gave it an ID tag, or tried to change the colors using .fontcolor,
      we had found that it made no effect on the output. But a little bit of thinking
      outside of the box led us to the solution. We discovered that after adding
      the div tag to the output, if we put an ID tag inside the div, we were
      able to link the CSS to the JS file and change the text color of the output.</p>
      <p>Bonus Task X #5: There was no challenge with step number 5, we knew that
      if we wanted to call the function on the user name, all we had to do was
      enter the user name as the function's argument when we actually needed to
      make a function call.</p>

      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>We were confused with the first step, since the challenges, problems,
      and results part, as well as the screenshots, usually come later on in
      the lab.</p>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>As you can see, our results can be seen down below:</p>
