		<p class="intro">Alejandro Silva-Serrano:</p>
		<p>Hi, my name is Alejandro with he/him/his pronouns and currently a junior.
			I was initially trying to major in CS: Game Design, but switched to AGPM
			after I failed CSE 15 in my fall quarter of my sophomore year. I have taken
			programming classes using python, java, JavaScript, and C++, however I find
			Java and JavaScript easier to understand. I like drawing, enjoy playing
			soccer and hanging out with friends, and am addicted to video games.</p>

		<p class="intro">Gillian Yu:</p>
		<p>Hi, my name is Gillian(she/her/hers), I'm a junior Art major in the process of declaring
			a double major in AGPM. In my free time I like to work with drawing
			digitally, painting with gouache/watercolor, or just plain sketching.
			I also know how to use acrylic paint and alcohol marker art.
			I have had a very brief experience with Java through a Summer class
			 (that didn't teach it very well), I took CSE 20 (Intro to Python) and
			 CSE 30 (Programming Abstractions Python). CSE 30 taught me not to hate
			 programming, but it did teach me a lot about the process,
			 which includes a lot of frustration but also satisfaction in solving the
			 problem. I want to expand my experience in a safe space where I can
			 hopefully learn more about the different programming languages while
			 continuing to do art. I am willing to put in the work to learn and do
			 my part of the work.</p>
