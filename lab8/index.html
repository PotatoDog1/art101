      <h1> Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks </h1>
      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>Once again we thought the most challenging parts were the problems within
      the bonus task.
      The first question wasn't as bad because we had an idea of
      the answer already. As we suspected, using document.writeln overwote all of
      the html.
      For the third question, we searched for "common methods that use callbacks"
      and found this W3Schools page. From that page, we were able to find multiple
      methods that use callbacks, and implemented one of them on our page. We
      started off with copy pasting one of the examples into our code, and the challenging
      part was trying to understand the code. This is because there were some words
      that we hadn't seen before, so we didn't understand them yet.
      We found that there were some parts that were unnecessary, so we took them out.
      </p>
      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>We tried to do Task X (2) but we were not able to get it to work.
      We wanted to print out the test argument and "This is the first test."
      However, when we tried to do this, we were only able to print "undefined:
      This is the first test."</p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>Our results can be seen on our page.</p>
      <h2>JavaScript Section </h2>
      <button onclick="myStartFunction()">Start</button>
      <button onclick="myStopFunction()">Stop</button>
