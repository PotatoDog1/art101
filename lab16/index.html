      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>	It was challenging for me to understand what Wes wanted us to do with
      Task 4. I didn’t know why they wanted us to assign the AJAX function to the
      variable comicObj, and after talking with the people on the class Discord at length,
      I was finally able to find out what they meant. Other than that, there weren’t
      really any challenges with this lab. Another challenge is that I was working
      on the lab by myself, but it wasn’t too bad because people helped me out on
     the class Discord.</p>
      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>There were no problems with the lab.</p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
