      <h1>Lab 14: Debugging Tools & Strategies</h1>

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>For this lab, both of us did not have any previous labs to debug or work
      on. Therefore, this lab was not challenging at all. We each feel pretty confident
      with our previous labs and they all do what we intended them to do. However
      something kind of, off-topic and something we think challenging is our group project.
      The lack of effort in this lab is because of our efforts towards our project.
      Hope you understand.</p>

      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>Likewise with the problems section, there was nothing problematic just how
      there was nothing challenging in this lab.</p>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>The results can be seen on our page.</p>
